*      Bitcoin Incognito (XBI)          *
*      masternode setup by tof          *
*                                       *
*****************************************

This installation script will download XBI 3.0.7
binaries for your version of Ubuntu with all the
required dependencies for your system.

--> Supported versions are :
Ubuntu 14.04 (X86_64 CPUs only)
Ubuntu 16.04 (X86_64 and ARM64)
Ubuntu 18.04 (X86_64 CPUs only)


Before we get started, some tests will be performed to
try to guess your version of Ubuntu ... some informations will
then be asked by the script that you will have to answer.

The installation has to be run as root or a priviledged user
(a user who can run the 'sudo' command, in which case the
password of that user will be asked if neccesary)

Also, i strongely recommend to run any software with a
dedicated user account. To do so, this script will propose
you to create a user whom you can choose the name.
The default proposition is to create a user 'xbi'.
(if it is good for your just type enter to accept)
Please paste your masternode private key :
===>> enter your masternode's private key <<===
Installing all required dependencies ... please wait !!!
(a full detailed log of this installation is written to :

Downloading XBI for you version (16.04) and CPU architecture (aarch64)

Now we will create a new user account to run XBI daemon.
You can just hit "ENTER" to use the proposed "xbi".
You will also need to set a password for that user !
Please choose a username to run XBI [xbi] :
Creating a dedicated user to run XBI :
xbi
Now choose a password for this new user !
(beware that it can NOT be an empty password ...
also don't worry if you see nothing when you type)
Enter new UNIX password:
Retype new UNIX password:
passwd: password updated successfully
Becoming user xbi to copy and run XBI binaries :
bin/xbi-cli
bin/xbid
bin/xbi-tx

Creating the XBI configuration file (in user's home)

-rw-rw-r-- 1 xbi xbi 418 Jun  6 20:17 /home/xbi/.XBI/xbi.conf
#Bitcoin Incognito (XBI) configuration file
#first of all, let's start in the background
daemon=1
#RPC server settings
server=1
rpcallowip=127.0.0.1
rpcuser=F21yKEA1yltIh8et
rpcpassword=uwfxdvUiev8WCFVyfOoGvU8z2ZqLzfPn
#network settings
listen=1
port=7250
externalip=VPSipV4
#masternode settings
masternode=1
#masternodeaddr=VPSipV4:7250
masternodeprivkey=MasternodePrivateKey

Now starting the daemon
XBI server starting
no crontab for xbi

To have xbid started after a reboot, this line was added to your crontab :
@reboot /home/xbi/bin/xbid
(run 'crontab -e' and choose your favorite editor to change this)


A full log of this setup can be found in /tmp/tmp.mHsZCXwKA0/install-XBI_20180606_20h14.log
The XBI daemon is started with the user xbi ...
To connect as that user, type 'sudo su - xbi'

Don't forget to update your local wallet's masternode.conf file as this :
"alias VPSipV4:7250 MasternodePrivateKey CollateralSendTxid X"

--> "alias" is the name you want to give to your new masternode
--> "VPSipV4:7250" are the VPS IP address and XBI default port
--> "CollateralSendTxid" is the output of "masternode outputs"
--> "X" is the index of this transaction id

Then you can manage your masternode from your local wallet.
The files created in /tmp/tmp.mHsZCXwKA0 can be deleted if you want ...

Bye, have fun with XBI, and thank you for using my script
